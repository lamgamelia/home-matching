# Home-Designer Matching Platform

## Problem Statement:

Home owners are often faced with the challenge of finding the right interior designer to bring their dreamy home to life. With the abundance of designing companies out at the market, it takes the home owners countless meetings and time to narrow their searches. Designers, on the other hand, are struggling to find new clients and expand their business. There is a need for a platform that can connect home owners with designers, simplifying the searching process through AI-driven matching algorithm.

## Key Features:

-Home owner registration: Home owners should be able to register on the platform via mobile phone, facebook, or google for quicker access. Home owners to fill in relevant project and design preferences, including but not limited to home type, estimated budget, key collection date
-Designer registration: Designers should be able to register on the platform, providing information about their portfolio, design styles, and services offered.
-Matching Algorithm: The platform should use sophisticated matching algorithm to connect home owners with designers based on a variety of factor and priortisation. Home owners should be presented with few designer choices where they can view the designers portfolio and reviews, before identifying the top 3 to engage in deeper discussion
-Project Management [optional]: The platform should have a scheduler where home owners/designers can manage their meetings/progress.
-In-app Messaging: The platform should allow home owners to chat with selected designers, to communicate and discuss on the projects, including sending pictures and attachments
-Review and rating systems: The platform should allow home owners to leave review for designers that they engaged or interact with, designers can also attach external review site such as facebook (or we can scrap it and inject them in the app to make whole interface more cohesive)
-Payment processing [TBC]: The platform should provide a secure payment processing option i.e. integrating with paypal etc, if we were to engage in payment handling process (eg. collection of deposit)

### Is the problem still relevant after some years?
Yes, the problem of home owners struggling to find the right designer among the increasing pool of designers remain relevant even after some years. Given by past trend - 44,500 designers in 2017 to 57,400 designers in 2022, we would expect the pool of designers will grow even further in the future. Thus, the need for a platform that can effectively connect home owners with satisfiable designers is likely to persist in the future.


### What is the challenging aspect of the problem?
The challenging aspact of this problem is to effectively matches home owners with designers that suits their need. A variety of factors including budget, location, design style, lifestyle etcs that have to be considered by the home owners when selecting their designer and different home owners may place different emphasis on the different factors. In addition, some home owners may not even realised their true concerns until several meetings with different designers, causing huge amount of time wasted for both home owners and the designers.

### What is our approach? What is novel about it?
By analysing some of the home ownersâ€™ inputs i.e. lifestyle, picture selection, picture upload etc, the platform will be able to effectively match them with designers with similar profiles. By using matching algorithm, it can help to sieve out designers who have less experience in the design styles that home owners looking for, resulting in huge time saving for both the home owners and the designers.

As the platform grows, machine learning can also be implemented on the data to optimise the searching algorithm, which will in turn result in more accurate matches for the home owners.

### How will you prevent others from copying your solution?
By applying patents on the matching algorithm and the design of the application, it can help to provide some legal protection. However, having patent on the matching algorithm might review the code, thus,  we may also choose to ensure the data and code are safely secured, applying the relevant industry-standard security measures to prevent unauthorised access to the code and data.
